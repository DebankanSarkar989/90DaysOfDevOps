# Setting up our GO enviroment 

Today we will deep dive into how to set up our GO enviroment in the local system . Before we head onto learning the basic of Go lang let us first walk through the steps to get Go installed in our local system . 

Lets install the Go lang from the <a href="https://go.dev/dl/ " > link here and download the installer based on the operating system you are working on . I will be working on the Windows system in this 90 days.

After downloading the installer based on the operating system you are operating on we can leave all the defaults in the place for now . Dnt worry if there is a version update and its not similar to mine . Proceed the same selecting the defaults still .

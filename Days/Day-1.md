# DevOps : Introduction (Day 1 )

Prior to stumbling upon DevOps, my fresher journey was primarily in software development. I had spent my college days as a developer, crafting code and building applications. While I enjoyed the creative aspects of coding, I began to notice that there were inherent challenges in the software development lifecycle that needed to be addressed.

One day, while I was attending a tech conference, I overheard a conversation about DevOps. It was one of those moments when a single word or phrase catches your attention and sparks your curiosity. I didn't fully understand what DevOps was at the time, but I was curious to learn more about it . I decided to delve deeper into this mysterious term, and that decision turned out to be pivotal.

DevOps wasn't just about writing code; it was about automating, testing, deploying, and monitoring that code as efficiently as possible. It promised to bridge the gap between development and operations teams, improving the speed and reliability of software releases.

I began my research, I quickly realized that DevOps was not just a buzzword, but a transformative approach to software development and IT operations. It aimed to break down silos, foster collaboration, and streamline the entire software delivery process. 

My learning path began with extensive online research. I devoured articles, watched webinars, and read books on DevOps principles, practices, and tools. The more I learned, the more I realized that DevOps was not just a set of tools or practices; it was a mindset. It required a shift in culture and a commitment to continuous improvement.




## The Journey Begins 
As a beginner myself in learning DevOps I want to document every step I learn while I pursure my DevOps Journey . I am committed to assisting fellow DevOps community members by curating a comprehensive list of resources. This compilation will include both freely accessible and paid resources, ensuring that everyone, regardless of their circumstances, can access valuable materials to support their DevOps journey. Over the coming days, I will gather and provide these resources to empower the community.

Share your journey and resources so we can learn in public and help each other.


## DevOps Roadmap 

While I was researching I crafted a customized DevOps roadmap. This roadmap is a reflection of my individual goals 
and experiences, tailored to help me acquire the essential skills and knowledge necessary to excel 
in the field of DevOps :<br><a href="https://excalidraw.com/#json=6o5K1OHtnL-tR1zqazW5i,JK_VDDWCO3Zd_OeQjxqnRQ">| DevOps roadmap 2023 |</a>

## Foundation Level: Understanding the Basics

### 1. Understanding DevOps 
- What is Devops ? What does a DevOps role do (Importance of understanding how Devops work and is needed in the industry )
Infrastructure | Automation | Monitoring 

### 2. Linux  
- In DevOps, understanding key Linux concepts is essential for effective server management and automation. Focus on learning file system navigation, command-line operations, user and group management, and basic shell scripting to streamline deployment and configuration processes on Linux servers. 
File System | Permissions | Shell Scripting | Editor ( vim, nano ) | Basic Linux commands 

### 3. Networking  
- Networking knowledge is crucial for seamless communication and infrastructure management. Key areas to learn include TCP/IP fundamentals, DNS configuration, firewalls, load balancers, and VPN setups to ensure robust connectivity and secure data transfer within your infrastructure. 
Gateways and Routing | DNS Records | TCP / IP protocols and ports | Subnetting , CIDR

### 4. Virtualization and OS
- Understanding virtualization is essential for efficient resource allocation and scalability. Focus on learning hypervisors like VMware and virtualization platforms like Docker and Kubernetes to create and manage virtualized environments that streamline application deployment and scaling.
  Most of the time we will be working of no of diverse platforms . 
Learning about Linux distributions (e.g., Ubuntu, CentOS) and Windows Server, focusing on system administration tasks, package management, and security to effectively manage and deploy applications across diverse OS environments is a must for DevOps engineers 

### 5. Programming and GIT
- Programming skills are integral to DevOps automation. Concentrate on scripting languages like Python, Ruby, Go or Shell scripting for task automation. 
- Additionally, grasp fundamental coding practices and version control concepts to develop infrastructure as code and automate deployment pipelines efficiently.
- Git is a cornerstone of version control in DevOps. Master Git workflows, branching strategies, and merge techniques. Learning to collaborate effectively with team members, manage code repositories, and integrate Git seamlessly into your continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) processes for version control and collaboration.

### 6. Cloud 
- Familiarize yourself with major cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. Learn cloud services, provisioning, infrastructure as code (IAC), and automation tools (e.g., AWS CloudFormation, Azure Resource Manager) to efficiently deploy and manage infrastructure in the cloud, enabling rapid development and deployment of applications.

### 7. Infrastructure as a Code in DevOps 
- In DevOps, Infrastructure as Code (IAC) is a fundamental concept. It involves managing and provisioning infrastructure resources using code rather than manual configurations. Learn IAC tools like Terraform or AWS CloudFormation, and practice defining infrastructure components in code to automate provisioning, scaling, and management, enabling consistent and repeatable infrastructure deployments.

## Advanced Level: Exploring and learning about CI/CD and Containerization

### 1. CI / CD 
- Understand CI/CD pipelines, version control integration, and automation tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, or Travis CI. Implement CI to automatically build, test, and integrate code changes, and use CD to automate deployments, ensuring fast and reliable software delivery.

### 2. Containerization
- Learn containerization technologies like Docker and container orchestration platforms such as Kubernetes. Master container creation, distribution, and orchestration to encapsulate applications and dependencies, making them portable and easy to deploy consistently across different environments.

For learning and mastering DevOps these 9 topics I have listed here in this repository will be benificial for beginners . Having a deep understandin on this indivitual areas would collectively help master the DevOps skills

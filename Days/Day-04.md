# DevOps and Agile Relationship

Before we move on to learn the difference between both the terms lets understands what "Agile" and "DevOps" mean and how they are different from each other . 

## Agile Methodology 

Agile methodology is a project management approach that prioritizes cross-functional collaboration and continuous improvement. It divides projects into smaller phases and guides teams through cycles of planning, execution, and evaluation.Instead of one big update the team focuses more on developing the  project into smaller phase and rolls out a new version of the product after certain days . 

## DevOps
As I explored in my previous days of learning DevOps , I would summarize what is Devops . DevOps emphasizes people (and culture), and seeks to improve collaboration between operations and development teams. DevOps implementations utilize technology— especially automation tools that can leverage an increasingly programmable and dynamic infrastructure from a life cycle perspective.DevOps deliver the working process in a simplied way to avoid miscommunications with the teams while working on the project . 

## Agile vs DevOps

DevOps is concerned about the philosophy of software development. Agile is a methadology which focuses on improving the quality of the product and its efficiency . These isnt any framework when it comes to DevOps . While implementing a project we need to focus on the tools that are needed to fulfil the specified requirements whereas in Agile its more based on the frameworks like SCRUM , Kanban ,Crystal , LEAN . 

### The Team aspect 
In Agile the work is dividen into multiple teams each having their own unique skillset to solve the project . Well there is a problem . If one of the team starts facing an issue with the current task they can say the others teams arent efficient and its a problem of other teams that they cant collaborate effectively . 
Whereas in DevOps , all the members of are equally trained on the same skillset . Does it make a difference ? Indeed it does . It helps the organization focus on the goal of completing a project as a whole team rather than working on the indivitual team's goal . 

### The Time based aspect vs Automation 
DevOps is more about automating the whole process and delivering the product without failure whereas if we look into Agile its more of a time based goal submission process . Its focused more on a feedback system it needs to provide to the organization after delivering the product . 

### Evaluation Process
The DevOps team evaluate the whole process and provide a proper feedback based on the requirements whereas in Agile the feedback process is provided by the customers .  There isnt any customer feedback in DevOps . The team fixes the error within themselves works on the scope of improving the product and delivering a better finished product to their customers . 

### Tools 

DevOps : Kubernetes , Docker , Git , Puppet , Ansible ,Jenkins <br>
Agile  : JIRA , Agile Bench , Active Collab 

### The End Goal for Agile and DevOps 

Devops is focused on minimizing the gap between the development teams and the operation team ensuring there is minimal latency in delivering the product and increased efficiency . 
Agile is focused on minimizing the gap between a customer's requirement and the developer's end product after testing.

## Agile DevOps integration

The integration between Agile and DevOps will bring some improved results in the following areas. 

It streamlines the release process of software and improves product quality.
The combination of DevOps and Agile will enhance better collaboration
Risk and release of the products will be minimized 
There will be fewer bugs in the project and faster fixed that increases visibility into the secured areas .Customers will be statisfied as the products delivered will be improved and ease to deliver .

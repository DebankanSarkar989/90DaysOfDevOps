# What is DevOps ? 

DevOps is derived from  “Development (dev)” and “Operations (ops)”. It is a combined development and operation to increase the speed, security and efficiency of the software development cycle for businesses to gain a competitive advantage against other business rivals.

## The Big Problem Solved
Software development consists of two different departments the “Development Team ” which develops the plan designs and builds the product from scratch and the “Operation Team” which tests and implements the product that is developed.

The operation team gives feedback on the bugs that are in the development team that require rework while the Development team is idle and awaits feedback from the operation team. This in turn delayed the entire software development cycle. There may be instances where the development team move to the next project while the operation team will still work on the previous task and provide feedback to the development team. So in turn it will take weeks and months to finish the project and final code to be developed.

What if these two teams work in collaboration with each other? There would be no confusion between the two teams. This is called the DevOps approach a continuous process of improving efficiency and constant change symbolized by the infinity DevOps symbol.

DevOps process builds upon the cross-functional approach used in Agile software development. In Agile, different teams work together to create and deliver software efficiently. DevOps extends this idea by not only involving various teams but also by incorporating operations aspects (like deployment and maintenance) into the development process, aiming to streamline the entire application lifecycle for faster and more reliable releases.

## Role of a DevOps Engineer 

A DevOps engineer play a crucial role in bridging the gap between development and operations, aiming to streamline the software delivery process, enhance collaboration, and ensure the reliability of systems. Here's an overview of what DevOps engineers do and how they solve daily problems: 

- #### Collaboration and Communication : 
     DevOps engineers work closely with development, testing, and operations teams to establish efficient communication channels. They facilitate cross-functional collaboration, ensuring that everyone understands the goals and requirements of the project.

- #### Automation: 
    A significant part of a DevOps engineer's role involves automating repetitive tasks and processes. They use tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, or Travis CI to create continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. This automation accelerates software delivery and reduces the risk of human error.

- #### Configuration Management:
     DevOps engineers use configuration management tools like Ansible, Puppet, or Chef to manage and provision infrastructure. They define infrastructure as code (IAC), allowing for consistent and repeatable deployments.

- #### Containerization:
     Containerization technologies like Docker are commonly used by DevOps engineers. They create and manage containers to package applications and their dependencies, making deployments more portable and efficient.

- #### Orchestration: 
    For managing containerized applications at scale, DevOps engineers often turn to orchestration platforms like Kubernetes. They design and maintain Kubernetes clusters, ensuring high availability and efficient resource utilization.

- #### Monitoring and Alerting: 
    DevOps engineers set up monitoring and alerting systems using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or ELK Stack. They continuously monitor system performance, identify issues, and take proactive measures to maintain uptime.

- #### Security: 
    Security is a top priority for DevOps engineers. They implement security best practices throughout the CI/CD pipeline, regularly scan for vulnerabilities, and work on threat mitigation strategies.

- #### Incident Management:
     In the event of system outages or incidents, DevOps engineers respond quickly to troubleshoot and resolve issues. They aim for a culture of blameless post-mortems to learn from incidents and prevent future occurrences.

- #### Cloud Services: 
    Many DevOps engineers work with cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. They deploy applications in the cloud, manage resources, and optimize costs.

- #### Documentation and Knowledge Sharing: 
    DevOps engineers maintain documentation and share knowledge with their teams. They ensure that best practices, procedures, and configurations are well-documented for future reference.

- #### Continuous Learning:
     DevOps is an ever-evolving field. DevOps engineers invest time in continuous learning to stay updated on the latest tools and practices. They might pursue certifications and attend conferences and workshops.

- #### Problem Solving: 
    DevOps engineers are problem solvers at their core. They tackle daily challenges related to deployment, scaling, configuration, performance, and security to ensure that systems run smoothly and reliably.

In essence, a DevOps engineer's role is all about optimizing the software development and delivery process, fostering collaboration, and using automation and best practices to address daily challenges efficiently. Their work is vital to achieving the goals of faster, more reliable software releases and improved system performance.

## Do I really need to master all the skills ? 

From what I've learned about DevOps, you don't necessarily have to be an expert in networking or infrastructure. What's crucial is having a foundational understanding of setting up and connecting various components, somewhat akin to having basic knowledge of a programming language without being a full-fledged developer.

It's also worth noting that you won't typically assume daily management of servers or applications. Instead, the emphasis is on automation and efficient operations.

While we often talk about servers, the reality is that modern applications are often designed to run within containers. These containers operate on servers, but it's essential to comprehend not just virtualization and cloud infrastructure (IaaS) but also containerization.

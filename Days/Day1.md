###DevOps: An Introductory Guide

##What is DevOps?

The word DevOps is derived from the two words “Development (dev)” and “Operations (ops)”. It is a combined development and operation to increase the speed, security and efficiency of the software development cycle for businesses to gain a competitive advantage against other business rivals.

##The Big Problem Solved

Software development consists of two different departments the “Development Team ” which develops the plan designs and builds the product from scratch and the “Operation Team” which tests and implements the product that is developed.

The operation team gives feedback on the bugs that are in the development team that require rework while the Development team is idle and awaits feedback from the operation team. This in turn delayed the entire software development cycle. There may be instances where the development team move to the next project while the operation team will still work on the previous task and provide feedback to the development team. So in turn it will take weeks and months to finish the project and final code to be developed.

What if these two teams work in collaboration with each other? There would be no confusion between the two teams. This is called the DevOps approach a continuous process of improving efficiency and constant change symbolized by the infinity DevOps symbol.

DevOps process builds upon the cross-functional approach used in Agile software development. In Agile, different teams work together to create and deliver software efficiently. DevOps extends this idea by not only involving various teams but also by incorporating operations aspects (like deployment and maintenance) into the development process, aiming to streamline the entire application lifecycle for faster and more reliable releases.

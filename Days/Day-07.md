# Programming for DevOps

## Why I choose GO instead of Python ? 
This was the hot topic when I came to learn DevOps whether I should go for learning GO from scratch or learn the Python well enough for DevOps work . Well sure as a fresher I did have some knowledge on how to work on Python libraries and functions but this 90 Days of DevOps journey I saw my mentor Michael Cade using GO for DevOps journey . 

### So why  GO ? 
At first I pondered upon this question on why one should choose Go instead of Python . Age old debate in the DevOps community to what should one opt for . Most of the tools written in DevOps like Kubernetes Dockers are written in Go . Some tools do have a Python background and it is upon the user's flexibility to choose what he or she should opt for . My mentor Michael Cade was working in a company called Kasten which was mostly a Cloud Native ecosystem focused on data management in Kubernetes and verything was written in Go . As for me I had a background in Python in my college days working and debugging projects made in it . So I thought why not give Go a try ? Even though it would entirely be from zero to mastering Go it would be a good try for me to learn about GO . 

Even if one is a beginner with little to no programming language I sure would guide through the entire process of learning Go as I proceed myself in this journey . 

## Go vs Python

Choosing between Go and Python for DevOps depends on various factors, and both languages have their merits. Here are reasons why Go is needed in DevOps:

#### Performance
Go is a statically typed, compiled language known for its speed and efficiency. In DevOps, tasks like building automation scripts, handling container orchestration, and managing infrastructure benefit from Go's performance, especially when dealing with large-scale systems.

#### Concurrency
 Go was designed with built-in support for concurrency through goroutines and channels. This feature is valuable in DevOps for tasks involving parallelism, such as managing multiple servers, handling asynchronous events, and orchestrating containers.

#### Static Typing
 Go's static typing helps catch errors at compile-time rather than runtime. This early error detection is crucial for maintaining the reliability and stability of DevOps tools and scripts.

#### Minimalist Syntax
Go has a straightforward and minimalist syntax, making it accessible to individuals without extensive programming backgrounds. DevOps professionals can quickly learn and use Go for writing efficient scripts and tools.

#### Cross-Platform Compatibility
Go can compile code to various platforms, making it suitable for creating cross-platform tools and binaries. This flexibility is essential in DevOps environments that involve a mix of operating systems and architectures.

#### Container Orchestration
Go is the primary language used for developing Kubernetes, the leading container orchestration platform in DevOps. Understanding Go can be beneficial for contributing to Kubernetes and customizing it for specific needs.

#### Infrastructure as Code
 Go can be used to create infrastructure as code (IaC) tools. When managing infrastructure through code, Go's performance, and efficiency can lead to faster provisioning and configuration.

#### Security
 Go's memory safety features help reduce the risk of security vulnerabilities in DevOps code. Security is a critical concern in DevOps, and Go's design can contribute to more robust and secure automation.

#### Community and Ecosystem
The DevOps community has seen an increase in Go adoption, leading to the development of relevant libraries and tools. This growing ecosystem makes Go a suitable choice for DevOps tasks.

#### Customization
 Go enables developers to create highly customized and efficient solutions tailored to specific DevOps requirements. This flexibility is valuable when building tools and automation scripts.

Today we explored the programming language we choose for the next couple of days to learn . We will be working on GO for now and later on as we proceed we may use python where I would surely guide as I proceed in these 90 days .

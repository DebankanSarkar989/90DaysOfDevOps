This repository is used to document my journey on getting a better foundational knowledge of "DevOps". I will be starting this journey on the September 2023 but the idea is that we take 90 days which just so happens to be September 2023 to November 2023.

The reason for documenting these days is so that others can take something from it and also hopefully enhance the resources.

This will not cover all things "DevOps" but it will cover the areas that I feel will benefit my learning and understanding overall.
